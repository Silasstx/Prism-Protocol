# Prism Protocol

> **Automated Yield Aggregation on Stacks**

Prism Protocol is a decentralized yield aggregation platform that automatically compounds rewards across multiple Stacks DeFi protocols, maximizing returns for users while minimizing active management requirements.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automated Compounding**: Smart yield optimization across multiple strategies
- **Multi-Protocol Integration**: Aggregate yields from various DeFi protocols
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Strategies are rated and balanced based on risk scores
- **Transparent Fee Structure**: Low protocol fees with clear fee distribution
- **Gas-Efficient Operations**: Optimized smart contract design for minimal transaction costs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) installed
- Stacks wallet with STX tokens
- Basic understanding of DeFi concepts

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/prism-protocol
cd prism-protocol
clarinet check
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Deposit STX**: Call `deposit` function with desired amount
2. **Earn Yield**: Protocol automatically compounds rewards
3. **Withdraw**: Use `withdraw` function to claim your share plus yields

## 📊 Protocol Overview

### Core Functionality

- **Deposit Management**: Users deposit STX and receive shares proportional to their contribution
- **Yield Strategies**: Multiple yield-generating strategies with risk assessments
- **Automated Compounding**: Smart contract automatically reinvests yields when thresholds are met
- **Fee Distribution**: Transparent fee structure supporting protocol development

### Security Features

- **Parameter Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
- **Access Control**: Critical functions restricted to authorized users
- **Emergency Controls**: Protocol owner can pause strategies if needed
- **Bounded Operations**: All calculations use safe arithmetic with bounds checking

## 🔧 Contract Functions

### User Functions

- `deposit(amount)`: Deposit STX tokens to earn yield
- `withdraw(shares)`: Withdraw your share of the pool
- `get-user-balance(user)`: Check user's current balance
- `calculate-user-value(user)`: Calculate current value of user's position

### Strategy Management

- `add-yield-strategy()`: Add new yield-generating strategy
- `compound-yield()`: Trigger compounding for a strategy
- `get-strategy-info()`: Get information about a strategy

### Protocol Administration

- `update-protocol-fee()`: Adjust protocol fee rate
- `emergency-pause-strategy()`: Pause a strategy in emergencies

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
clarinet test
```

## 📈 Yield Strategies

The protocol supports multiple yield strategies with different risk profiles:

1. **Conservative**: Low-risk strategies with stable returns
2. **Balanced**: Medium-risk strategies balancing yield and safety
3. **Aggressive**: Higher-risk strategies with potential for greater returns

## 🛡️ Security

- All user funds are secured by battle-tested smart contract patterns
- Multi-signature controls for protocol upgrades
- Regular security audits and community reviews
- Transparent on-chain operations
